Only the jungler, master of all four dragons could kill it. But when the team needed him most, he missed smite. The game ended and my duo and I discovered a new jungler. He says he's a Diamond smurf, but he has to prove himself if he is going to carry the team. But, I believe this jungler can smite the dragon.**",
